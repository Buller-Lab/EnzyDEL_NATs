# Engineering an enzyme cascade for a broad substrate scope facilitates DNA-encoded library technology

In this repository we provide the code that was used for binding pocket analysis using pyKVFinder [1] as well as Boltz-2 [2,3] based cofolding of different N-acetyltransferases with their DNA-tagged substrates (30 diffussion model replicates). Subsequently, a ligand RMSD-based clustering script based on MDTraj [4] and scikit-learn [5] was utilized to identify the largest cluster and select it's centroid as representative conformation.
